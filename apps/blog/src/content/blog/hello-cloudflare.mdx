Welcome to the new version of **alexandersumer.com**. This site runs on [Astro](https://astro.build) and deploys to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), which means every post goes live at the edge in seconds.

## Why this setup works

- **Astro** keeps the reading experience fast by shipping only the JavaScript a page needs.
- **Cloudflare Pages** gives us instant rollbacks, preview builds, and global caching out of the box.
- **MDX** lets me mix Markdown with interactive components if a post ever needs it.

Stay tuned for deep dives into distributed systems, developer tooling, and notes from the field.
